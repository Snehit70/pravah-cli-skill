# Pravah CLI v2

Use this skill against the live `pravah` CLI. Pravah is a single-user planning system. Run a write only when the user explicitly requests that exact change; do not infer permission to mutate planning data from an inspection request.

Pravah CLI v2 prints human-readable output by default. Pass `--json` whenever structured data will be read or verified. Its JSON envelope is the machine contract: require a successful exit, `ok: true`, then use `data`.

## Start and discover

1. Run `pravah doctor --json` when diagnosing setup or before a workflow whose local readiness is unknown. It is read-only.
2. Run `pravah auth status --json` when authentication or scopes matter. Do not use removed v1 commands such as `auth whoami` or `auth list-scopes`.
3. Use `pravah capabilities --json` or the specific command's `--help` for the current contract. Do not scrape human output or assume this page is exhaustive.
4. Use the narrowest command and `--json` for agent work.

If `pravah` is unavailable and the current checkout is Pravah, run `bun run pravah -- <command> ...`. Never edit the credential store, print credentials, or bypass server authorization. Use `auth login` or `auth logout` only when the user explicitly asks to configure or remove this host's local credential.

## Read commands

```bash
pravah tasks list --json
pravah inbox --json
pravah today --json
pravah overdue --json
pravah upcoming --json
pravah tasks show <task-id-or-exact-title> --json
pravah goals list --json
pravah goals show <goal-id-or-exact-name> --json
pravah operations list --json
pravah operations show <operation-id> --json
pravah agent context --json
```

`tasks list` is the prioritized planning horizon. Filter it with `--goal`, `--priority`, `--tag`, `--status`, `--date`, `--before`, `--after`, or `--all` as needed. Use `--long` only for human-readable expanded detail; it cannot be combined with `--json`.

Task and Goal targets accept an ID or an exact unique title/name. If a target is ambiguous, stop and present the candidates; never guess or fuzzy-match a write target.

All v2 reads above require `tasks:read` except `doctor` and `capabilities`, which require no scopes. `agent context` is task-only and deliberately compact; use `tasks show` for focused task detail.

## Explicit writes

Task and Goal writes, including `operations undo`, require `tasks:write`. For an explicitly requested write:

1. Before creating a Goal, run `pravah goals list --json`; inspect existing Goals and their linked Tasks first. Reuse the relevant Goal when one exists. Create a new Goal only when the user explicitly wants a distinct outcome or no existing Goal fits.
2. Resolve the exact target first when it is not already unambiguous.
3. Run the same command with `--dry-run --json`.
4. Apply the command with `--json`.
5. Read back the affected Task, Goal, or operation and verify the requested state. For work requested under a Goal, verify that the resulting Task is actually linked to that Goal; do not treat matching names, descriptions, or tags as a link.
6. Report the operation receipt and Undo reference when returned.

The CLI generates an idempotency key for each write. Supply `--idempotency-key <stable-key>` only when a caller needs to retry safely across separate invocations; reuse that key for the preview, apply, and retry of the same intended change. Use `--operation-group-id <group-id>` when multiple requested writes should be undoable together.

```bash
# Create, edit, and plan a Task
pravah tasks add "Title" --priority p1 --dry-run --json
pravah tasks add "Title" --priority p1 --json
pravah tasks edit <task> --description "Notes" --dry-run --json
pravah tasks schedule <task> --date YYYY-MM-DD --dry-run --json
pravah tasks unschedule <task> --dry-run --json
pravah tasks complete <task> --dry-run --json
pravah tasks reopen <task> --dry-run --json

# Create or edit a Goal
pravah goals add "Title" --deadline YYYY-MM-DD --dry-run --json
pravah goals edit <goal> --priority p1 --dry-run --json

# Recover one write or a requested group
pravah operations undo <operation-id> --dry-run --json
pravah operations undo --group <group-id> --dry-run --json
```

Apply the corresponding non-dry-run command only after its preview succeeds. Use the same options, including a caller-provided stable key where applicable.

`tasks remove` and `goals remove` are recoverable, but still require both clear user intent for that exact target and `--confirm`. Completion, reopening, scheduling, unscheduling, editing, creation, and undo also change live planning data, so require explicit user intent even though they do not take `--confirm`.

## Guardrails

- Never mutate Pravah data from an implied request or a planning discussion.
- Treat a non-zero exit or `ok: false` as a real failure; report the actionable failure and do not try alternate auth paths or mock data.
- Never use removed v1 commands or held integration commands: `review`, `sync`, `agent task`, `tasks get/update/move/delete`, `goals create/get/delete`, `auth whoami`, and `auth list-scopes` are not the v2 contract.
- Prefer `operations list` and `operations show` to inspect recovery history. Undo only an operation or group the user explicitly identifies.
- Keep bootstrap tokens and bearer credentials out of output, logs, and command history whenever possible.
